Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Implementation

This project presents a clean, modular implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, applied to continuous control tasks within the OpenAI Gymnasium environment. The primary goal is to provide a foundational understanding of PPO's core mechanics and demonstrate its practical application on a challenging benchmark environment.
Why This Project is Good

    Foundational Understanding: Implementing PPO from scratch (or with minimal library reliance for core logic) on a standard OpenAI Gym environment demonstrates a deep understanding of core RL concepts:

        Policy gradients

        Advantage estimation (Generalized Advantage Estimation - GAE)

        Clipped surrogate objective

        Value function approximation

        Training loops (data collection, optimization steps)

    Proof of Concept: Successfully training an agent to solve a well-known benchmark like LunarLanderContinuous-v2 shows practical application of the algorithm.

    Standard Practice: PPO is a widely used and robust algorithm, making this a relevant skill for any RL researcher or practitioner.

Advanced Research Demonstration Aspects

To elevate this project for "advanced research" demonstration, the implementation is structured to facilitate further analysis and experimentation:

    Challenging Environment: We target LunarLanderContinuous-v2, which involves continuous action spaces, requiring careful PPO tuning and showcasing handling of more complex control tasks compared to simpler discrete environments like CartPole.

    Analysis and Ablations (Future Work / Your Contribution): The modular design lays the groundwork for in-depth analysis:

        Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis: Investigate how different learning rates, clip ratios, GAE lambda values, or network architectures affect performance.

        Comparison to a Baseline: Compare PPO's performance to a simpler algorithm (e.g., A2C or REINFORCE) to highlight PPO's advantages.

        Visualization: Integration with TensorBoard allows for visualizing policies, value functions, and training curves to provide insights.

    Code Quality: The codebase emphasizes modularity, readability, and good software engineering practices for maintainability and extensibility.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+

    Git (optional, if cloning the repository)

Steps

    Clone the repository (or create the project structure manually):

    git clone <your-repo-url> # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd ppo_project

    If not using Git, manually create the ppo_project directory and all the .py files within it as provided in the previous steps.

    Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

    Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Important Note for Windows Users (Box2D/LunarLander):
    The gymnasium[box2d] dependency, required for LunarLanderContinuous-v2, often needs the SWIG compiler to be installed and available in your system's PATH. If pip install fails with an error related to box2d-py or swig.exe, follow these steps:

        Download SWIG: Go to http://www.swig.org/download.html and download the latest stable Windows binary (e.g., swigwin-4.x.x.zip).

        Extract: Extract the .zip file to a simple, permanent location (e.g., C:\swigwin).

        Add to PATH: Add the directory where swig.exe is located (e.g., C:\swigwin) to your system's Path environment variable.

            Search "Environment Variables" in Windows.

            Click "Edit the system environment variables" -> "Environment Variables..."

            Under "System variables", select Path -> "Edit..." -> "New" -> Add your SWIG path.

            Click OK on all windows.

        Open a NEW terminal/command prompt (important for PATH changes to take effect).

        Activate your virtual environment again and retry pip install gymnasium[box2d].

Usage
Training the Agent

To start training the PPO agent on LunarLanderContinuous-v2:

python main.py

You will see console output detailing episode rewards and lengths as training progresses.
Monitoring Training with TensorBoard

While training is running, you can monitor the learning progress visually:

    Open a new terminal (keep the training terminal running).

    Navigate to the ppo_project directory.

    Run TensorBoard:

    tensorboard --logdir runs

    Open your web browser and go to the address provided by TensorBoard (usually http://localhost:6006). Here you can view graphs for:

        Episode/Reward

        Episode/Length

        Loss/Actor_Loss

        Loss/Critic_Loss

        Metrics/Entropy

        Metrics/Clip_Fraction

        And others that indicate overall training progress.

Evaluating a Trained Agent

After training (or to evaluate a previously saved model), you can use the evaluate method.
First, ensure you have a trained model saved in the trained_models/ directory.

To evaluate:

    Modify main.py:
    Comment out agent.train() and uncomment the agent.evaluate() call. If you want to load a specific model, add a load_model call before evaluate.

    # ppo_project/main.py (example modification for evaluation)
    # ...
    def main():
        config = PPOConfig()
        os.makedirs(config.LOG_DIR, exist_ok=True)
        os.makedirs(config.SAVE_DIR, exist_ok=True)

        agent = PPOAgent(config)

        # To load a specific model for evaluation:
        # model_path = os.path.join(config.SAVE_DIR, "ppo_agent_step_204800.pth") # Adjust filename
        # agent.load_model(model_path) 

        # agent.train() # Comment this out for evaluation

        # Evaluate the agent (set render=True to visualize if configured)
        agent.evaluate(num_episodes=10, render=False) 
    # ...

    Run python main.py again.

Customizing Hyperparameters

All hyperparameters are defined in config.py. You can easily modify values like N_STEPS, N_EPOCHS, ACTOR_LR, CLIP_EPSILON, etc., to experiment with different settings.
Results

(This section is for you to fill in after you've run your training!)

    Describe the performance observed on LunarLanderContinuous-v2. What was the typical maximum reward achieved? How many steps/episodes did it take to converge?

    Include screenshots of your TensorBoard graphs (e.g., Reward over steps, Losses).

    (Optional but highly recommended) If you set up rendering, include a short GIF or video of your trained agent playing the game.

Future Work and Enhancements

This project serves as a robust foundation. Here are areas for further exploration to demonstrate advanced research capabilities:

    Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis: Conduct systematic experiments by varying key hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, clip ratio, GAE λ, network sizes) and analyze their impact on training stability, convergence speed, and final policy performance. Document observations and insights.

    Comparison to Baselines: Implement a simpler on-policy algorithm like Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) or REINFORCE. Compare its performance, stability, and data efficiency against your PPO implementation.

    More Challenging Environments: Test the PPO implementation on more complex continuous control environments such as BipedalWalker-v3 or even MuJoCo environments (if you have access), requiring further tuning and robustness.

    Distributed Training: Explore how to scale the data collection process using multiple parallel environments (e.g., using gymnasium.vector.make).

    Performance Optimizations: Investigate techniques like observation normalization, reward scaling, or different network architectures to improve performance.

    Code Refinements: Add more comprehensive error handling, type hinting, and unit tests.
